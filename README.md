**2022.04.12** Our new work, [**Simple Baselines for Image Restoration**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04676) reveals the nonlinear activation functions, e.g. ReLU, GELU, Sigmoid, and etc. are **not necessary** to achieve SOTA performance. The paper provide a simple baseline, NAFNet: Nonlinear Activation Free Network for Image Restoration tasks, and acheves SOTA performance on Image Denoising and Image Deblurring. The paper and the code are available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04676 / https://github.com/megvii-research/NAFNet respectively.
